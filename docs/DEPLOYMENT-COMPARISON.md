## When to Choose AWS

Choose AWS Fargate if you:
- ‚úÖ Already use AWS extensively
- ‚úÖ Need deep AWS service integration (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Have AWS credits or enterprise agreements
- ‚úÖ Require VPC networking and advanced networking features
- ‚úÖ Need consistent compute capacity
- ‚úÖ Prefer CloudFormation for IaC

## When to Choose GCP

Choose GCP Cloud Run if you:
- ‚úÖ Want lowest cost (especially with variable traffic)
- ‚úÖ Prefer simplicity and ease of deployment
- ‚úÖ Want true serverless (scale to zero)
- ‚úÖ Use other Google services (Gmail API fits naturally)
- ‚úÖ Have spiky or unpredictable traffic
- ‚úÖ Prefer Terraform for IaC
- ‚úÖ Want faster iteration and deployment

## Recommendation

### For Most Users: **GCP Cloud Run** üèÜ

**Reasons:**
1. **Cost-effective** - Pay only for what you use, scale to zero
2. **Simpler** - Less infrastructure to manage
3. **Faster** - Quicker deployments and easier debugging
4. **Gmail Integration** - Makes sense for Gmail API service
5. **Developer-friendly** - Better CLI and tooling

### For Enterprise/AWS-Heavy Users: **AWS Fargate**

**Reasons:**
1. **Existing Infrastructure** - Leverage existing AWS setup
2. **Enterprise Support** - Better for large organizations already on AWS
3. **Compliance** - If you need specific AWS compliance certifications
4. **Networking** - Advanced VPC and networking requirements

## Migration Between Platforms

Both deployments share the same codebase, so switching is straightforward:

```bash
# From AWS to GCP
1. Export user data from AWS Secrets Manager
2. Run GCP setup scripts
3. Import user data to GCP Secret Manager
4. Update DNS to point to new Cloud Run URL

# From GCP to AWS
1. Export user data from GCP Secret Manager
2. Deploy AWS CloudFormation stack
3. Import user data to AWS Secrets Manager
4. Update DNS to point to new ALB URL
```

## Quick Start Guide

### GCP (Recommended for most users)

```bash
# 1. Setup
./scripts/setup_gcp.sh your-project-id us-central1

# 2. Configure credentials
python3 scripts/setup_gcp_gmail_credentials.py your-project-id

# 3. Deploy
./scripts/deploy_gcp.sh your-project-id us-central1

# Done! ‚úÖ
```

### AWS

```bash
# 1. Setup credentials
python3 setup_gmail_credentials.py

# 2. Deploy infrastructure
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file infrastructure/cloudformation.yml \
  --stack-name emailmcp-stack \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

# 3. Deploy application
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Done! ‚úÖ
